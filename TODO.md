# Authentication Fix for Project Routes

## ‚úÖ Completed
- **Fixed Authentication Issue**: Uncommented `useAuthenticatedBlitzContext` in `src/app/projects/layout.tsx`
- **Verified Login Route**: Confirmed `/login` route exists at `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- **Authentication Flow**: Users will now be redirected to `/login` when accessing `/project` routes without authentication

## üîß Technical Details
- **Problem**: Authentication middleware was active at API level but disabled in layout
- **Solution**: Enabled server-side authentication check in projects layout
- **Impact**: Project routes now require authentication, unauthenticated users redirected to login

## üß™ Testing Steps
1. **Test Unauthenticated Access**:
   - Clear cookies/session
   - Try accessing `/project` or `/project/example`
   - Should redirect to `/login`

2. **Test Authenticated Access**:
   - Login through `/login`
   - Access `/project` routes
   - Should display projects normally

3. **Test API Calls**:
   - Verify `ProjectsList` component can fetch data
   - Check that `usePaginatedQuery(getProjects)` works properly

## üìù Notes
- Authentication is enforced at both layout level (redirect) and API level (withBlitzAuth)
- Users must be logged in to view project listings
- Login page is properly configured and accessible
